# Interactive Line Chart – Life Expectancy Over Time  
### Individual Assignment 3: D3.js Implementation  
*Information Visualization – TU Wien*

---

##  Overview  
This project is my implementation for **Individual Assignment 3** of the Information Visualization course.  
The goal of the assignment is to create **one D3-based visualization**.

I implemented an **interactive line chart** that displays **life expectancy over time** for any selected country. Users can choose a country from a dropdown menu, and the visualization updates dynamically.

This visualization supports project tasks such as:
- Exploring trends over time  
- Tracking improvements or declines  
- Comparing countries one at a time

##  Visualization  
The chart is built using **D3.js (v7)** and includes:
- A dropdown menu to select a country  
- A dynamic single-line trend  
- Clean axes and labels  
- Light gridlines  
- Title and improved readability  

It uses only the necessary dataset attributes:
- `country`  
- `year`  
- `life_expectancy`
